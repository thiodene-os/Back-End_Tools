# Install the Twilio PHP Helper Library
# We need to install the Twilio PHP Helper Library in the directory where you will complete the quickstart. 
# If you are using Composer, there are two ways to do this.

# First, from a terminal, you can run the following command:
# -> Twilio needs Composer to be installed
php composer.phar require twilio/sdk
composer require twilio/sdk
